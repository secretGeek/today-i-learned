<h1 id="narcissism-of-small-differences">Narcissism of small differences</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>it is precisely communities with adjoining territories and close relationships that engage in constant feuds and mutual ridicule because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, because Java and C# are so similar, their users are more likely to feud, not less.</p>
<p>At a smaller scale: tabs and spaces make no difference to a running program, so proponents of each are the most likely to feud.</p>
<p>Same for brace positioning.</p>
<p>People pour effort into these things because they are a way of asserting their identity (either group identity or individual identity).</p>
<p>(Research shows me that <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/05/narcissism-of-small-code-differences.html">Raganwald spotted this in 2008</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6710668">discussion</a>))</p>
<p>Joke from Emo Phillips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once I saw this guy on a bridge about to jump. I said, &quot;Don't do it!&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Nobody loves me.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;God loves you. Do you believe in God?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Are you a Christian or a Jew?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;A Christian.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Me, too! Protestant or Catholic?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Protestant.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Me, too! What franchise?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Baptist.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Me, too! Northern Baptist or Southern Baptist?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Northern Baptist.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist or Northern Liberal Baptist?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Northern Conservative Baptist.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region, or Northern Conservative Baptist Eastern Region?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Me, too! Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1879, or Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912?&quot;</p>
<p>He said, &quot;Northern Conservative Baptist Great Lakes Region Council of 1912.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Die, heretic!&quot; And I pushed him over.</p>
