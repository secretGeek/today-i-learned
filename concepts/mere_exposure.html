<h1 id="mere-exposure">Mere Exposure</h1>
<p>If you see something often enough you begin to think it is as it should be.</p>
<p>Even if you've only seen something one time, you think it's better than a thing you've seen zero times.</p>
<p>Example. If you put Donald Trump on reality TV in US living rooms every week, next thing he'll end up being nominated as a Presidential candidate.</p>
<p>You need to be very careful about what you are exposed to.</p>
