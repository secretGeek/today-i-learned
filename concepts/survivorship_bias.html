<p>&quot;Just because nobody complains doesn't mean all parachutes are perfect.&quot;

<p>An example of a selection bias.</p>
<p>You don't get the opportunity to gather evidence from the &quot;non-survivors&quot;. Hence the evidence you do see is wildly tainted.</p>
<p>e.g</p>
<p>&quot;The advice business is a monopoly run by survivors. When something becomes a non-survivor, it is either completely eliminated, or whatever voice it has is muted to zero.&quot;</p>
<p>We discount the role of luck (particularly when telling our own stories).</p>
<p>If enough scientists study a phenomenon, some will find statistically significant results by chance, and these are the experiments submitted for publication. Additionally, papers showing positive results may be more appealing to editors.</p>
<h3 id="another-example-of-a-selection-bias">Another example of a selection bias</h3>
<p>When scientists began finding exo-planets (planets that orbit a star other than the sun) the first exo planets they found were massive. These were the only exo-planets that their methods were capable of detecting.</p>
<p>Journalists dutifully reported that most planets in the universe are gigantic, many times larger than Jupiter, and Earth is some kind of freakishly small anomaly, unique in a universe of gas giants. Thanks, Journalists!</p>
