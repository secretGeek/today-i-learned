<p>The greatest exposition of the echo chamber problem comes from this comic:</p>

<p>You can get an insight into the problem we face today where people live in their own 'ideological bubbles' by visiting
<a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/">Red feed blue feed at Wall street Journal</a></p>
<p>An excellent article that can reveal your own ingroup-outgroup bias is available from <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">I can tolerate anything except the out group</a></p>
<p>Another example of an echo-chamber effect is what was known as the Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reality distortion field (RDF) is a term coined by Bud Tribble at Apple Computer in 1981, to describe company co-founder Steve Jobs's charisma and its effects on the developers working on the Macintosh project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The common criticism of academia as existing within 'Ivory Towers' is about Echo chambers/Ideological bubbles.</p>
<p>Your echo-chamber, your ideological bubble, your personal RDF -- are all related to your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view">World View</a>. The term 'World View' has been brought into English from the German philosophical concept: Weltanschauung.</p>
