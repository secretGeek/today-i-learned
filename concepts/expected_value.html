<h1 id="expected-value">Expected Value</h1>
<p>Expected Value (EV) is how much you would expect to make, on average, if you repeated an experiment (or gamble) a large number of times.</p>
<p>If you pay $1 for a one in five chance of winning $2, then the expected value is $0.40 and you might decline the offer.</p>
<p>A gamble with an expected value of more than $1 per dollar is only worth taking if you can afford to take the loss. Russian roulette is an example of a game you shouldn't play regardless of the EV, because you can't afford to lose.</p>
<p>Lottery generally has an expected value of less than the face value of the tickets. But in a jackpot scenario the EV is higher, and can be higher than the face value of the ticket.</p>
