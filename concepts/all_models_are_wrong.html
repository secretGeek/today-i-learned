<h1 id="all-models-are-wrong-some-models-are-useful">All Models are Wrong, Some Models are Useful</h1>
<p>The saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All models are wrong, some are useful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...is from British statistician, George Box</p>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>When you set out to &quot;model&quot; or &quot;simulate&quot; some system or process in the real world, your model will start off as a drastic oversimplification of the thing you are modelling.</p>
<p>Then you may refine the model and it may be a little more similar to the thing you are modelling.</p>
<p>Stop right there.</p>
<p>The goal of modelling is to get useful results. It is not to make a perfect recreation of the thing that is being modelled.</p>
<p>If you attempt to make a perfect model, you will never achieve it. You could spend your life trying to make a &quot;perfect&quot; model of the interactions between the atoms within a single grain of sand.</p>
<p>Only two things are certain about your modelling effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will die before you correct the errors in the model</li>
<li>That is all we know.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the goal must never be to make a perfect &quot;thing&quot; -- but rather to stop when the thing is useful, usable. Ideally we stop before we reach &quot;the point of diminishing returns.&quot; If we find we have blown right past the point of diminishing returns, then stop right now.</p>
<h2 id="extrapolating-the-rule-everywhere">Extrapolating the rule everywhere</h2>
<p>The rule doesn't just apply to a statistician's attempt at modelling a process. I'm happy to extend it to every other domain of life...</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>All maps are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All models are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All recipes are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All religions are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All guitar tabs are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All observations are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All measurements are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All maths lessons are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All building plans are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All physics theories are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All economic theories are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All political parties are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All weather forecasts are wrong, some are useful</li>
<li>All articles you read at TIL.secretGeek.net are wrong, some are useful</li>
</ul>
<p>(Never listen to anyone who gives you advice, particularly me. (See also <a href="https://wiki.secretgeek.net/paradox">Paradox</a>))</p>
<h2 id="a-question">A Question</h2>
<p>All models are wrong -- some are useful.</p>
<p>But who owns the models? Who chooses the models? Who filters the models?</p>
<p>The question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If all models are wrong, but some are useful, who are they useful for?</p>
</blockquote>
