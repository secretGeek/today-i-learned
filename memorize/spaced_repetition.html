<p>on iOS I use an app called &quot;CleverDeck&quot;</p>
<p>I've even put sight-words and dolce-words in there for my youngest child to learn from (she's learning to read)</p>
<p>Another child has a copy of clever deck she used for finally solidifying her knowledge of the &quot;times tables&quot; she couldn't quite get clear in her mind. 7<em>8, 11</em>12, and a few like that.</p>
<p>With clever deck you can quickly add your own cards.</p>
<p>A single fact may be best represented by more than 3 cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>word ↷ definition</li>
<li>definition ↷ word</li>
<li>example with word missing ↷ example with word filled in. (note: this is called cloze deletion)</li>
</ul>
