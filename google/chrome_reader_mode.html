<h1 id="chrome-reader-mode-distill-page">Chrome reader mode: 'Distill page'</h1>
<p>When reading a hard-to-read-due-to-formatting webpage on my iPhone I hit a little icon, called 'reader mode' that makes it all magically readable.</p>
<p>You can achieve reader mode on Chrome as well, if you enable the feature.</p>
<p>Edit the shortcut you use to launch chrome and append this parameter to the <code>Target</code></p>
<pre><code>--enable-dom-distiller
</code></pre>
<p>Restart chrome and then you'll find a 'Distill page' option in the settings menu.</p>
<p>I find that zooming is also helpful, even with the new reading glasses.</p>
<p>The feature is not particularly well implemented, and not widely used. Since maintaining it and improving will require a lot of work, I expect it to quietly die a death of a thousand bugs over the next few years. But we'll see.</p>
<p>Other keywords: readability, legible, legibility, declutter, adblock, ad-block</p>
