<p>(This is information I received from 'ask a librarian')</p>
<p>To use the Bolinda/Borrowbox collection, you will first need to create a Bolinda/Borrowbox account. Follow these steps to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the library website: <a href="https://library.brisbane.qld.gov.au/">https://library.brisbane.qld.gov.au/</a></li>
<li>Click on the eBooks and Downloads icon</li>
<li>Click on the Audiobooks icon</li>
<li>Click on the Bolinda link</li>
<li>The Bolinda website will appear. Click on the green Sign in button</li>
<li>Sign in with your library barcode and PIN</li>
<li>Complete the short registration form that appears</li>
<li>Click on Help  to see information about using the collection</li>
</ul>
<p>Links to the Borrowbox app for Androids and iOS devices are on the Audiobooks page.</p>
<p>The loan period for Bolinda/Borrowbox items is two weeks. If there are no holds on the item, you can immediately renew it for another two weeks.</p>
<p>There are three apps you will want:</p>
<ol>
<li>Borrowbox</li>
<li>Libby (from Overdrive)</li>
<li>RbDigital</li>
</ol>
<p>Overdrive is a famous app, but the same company has released a much nicer app called <strong>Libby</strong>.</p>
<p>The apps, BorrowBox, Libby and RbDigital, each give you access to different audiobooks (and ebooks) from the library.</p>
<p>With RbDigital and Brisbane City Countil the trick is to register yourself at this location:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rbdigital.com/brisbane/">https://www.rbdigital.com/brisbane/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you try just registering directly in the RbDigital app or at the homepage of RbDigital, it will not work. You <em>must</em> go to <a href="https://www.rbdigital.com/brisbane/">https://www.rbdigital.com/brisbane/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-libraries">Other libraries</h2>
<p>Also, it is theoretically possible to sign up at other libraries, whose area you do not live within, and receive access to their audiobooks as well. I haven't explored this sufficiently as I am already swamped with thousands of things to read.</p>
