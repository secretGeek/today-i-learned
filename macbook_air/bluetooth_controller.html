<h1 id="no-bluetooth-in-settings-devices">No bluetooth in Settings -&gt; Devices</h1>
<p>And bluetooth generally not present anywhere on the machine.</p>
<p>In device manager:</p>
<p>Other devices -&gt; &quot;Bluetooth USB Host Controller&quot; has a warning icon. And there was no info about the device.
No manufacturer etc.</p>
<p>Trick was to update the drivers and then point it at the &quot;AppleBluetoothBroadcom64&quot; folder -- which I already had from previous times I faced this issue.</p>
<p>Previously I have downloaded all of the BootCamp drivers, and unzipped them to here:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\Leon\Downloads\BootCamp5.1.5640\$WinPEDriver$\AppleBluetoothBroadcom64
</code></pre>
<p>So I updated the drivers and browsed to that location.</p>
<p>Then it believed that bluetooth was A-OK again.</p>
