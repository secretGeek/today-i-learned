<p>Simplest way to get started is to use <code>nano</code>. It's included in many distros including ubuntu.</p>
<pre><code>$ nano filename
</code></pre>
<p>nano is a clone of pico. pico also seems to be included.</p>
<p>It's pretty intuitive. It all happens in the console. There is a list of commands at the foot of the terminal, so the barrier to entry is low.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Keys</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ctrl O</td>
<td>Write out... i.e. SAVE.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ctrl W</td>
<td>Where is... i.e. find text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ctrl X</td>
<td>Exit... It warns you if you try to exit without saving.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>Now <code>vim</code> is also available. It's far more powerful, but with a learning curve.</p>
<p>It will never ever go away as long as you live. So any effort spent moving up that learning curve will continue to be of value forever.</p>
<p>(Early in the Foundation Series of novels by Isaac Asimov, the character Hari Seldon uses a special calculator to prove that the Galactic Empire will collapse. The conclusion is inescapable and the intelligent people begin to prepare for it. Others don't.</p>
<p>I'm like that, but with vim. Any simple analysis of how the future will play out proves that it is worth learning vim. It is a shocking and inescapable realization. I should begin to prepare for it.)</p>
