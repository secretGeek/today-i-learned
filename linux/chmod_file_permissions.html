<pre><code>$ chmod 777 /opt/webapps
</code></pre>
<p>Causes these permissions:</p>
<pre><code>drwxrwxrwx
</code></pre>
<p>How is this true? What does this mean?</p>
<p>777 -- three digits, each digit is the value of 3 flags, 3 bits.</p>
<p>7, in binary, is 111.</p>
<p>Each digit refers to three different groups:</p>
<p>This</p>
<pre><code>drwxrwxrwx
</code></pre>
<p>...can be broken out into 4 categories:</p>
<pre><code>d  rwx   rwx   rwx
</code></pre>
<p>Concentrate on those last three, the repeated 'rwx's...</p>
<pre><code> +---------------  Permissions of the owner of the file,
 |     +---------  The group associated with the file, and
 |     |     +---  Everybody else.
 |     |     |
rwx   rwx   rwx
|||   |||   |||
|||   |||   ||+-- execute permission for everybody else
|||   |||   |+--- write permission for everybody else
|||   |||   +---- read permission for everybody else

|||   ||+-- execute permission for the group associated with the file
|||   |+--- write permission for the group associated with the file
|||   +---- read permission for the group associated with the file

+---- read permission for the owner of the file
   
</code></pre>
<p>r = read permission
w = write permission
x = execute permission</p>
<p>If a permission was missing it would be represented by a dash '-'.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chmod</code> - modify permissions</li>
<li><code>chown</code> - change the owner of the file</li>
<li><code>chgrp</code> - change the group</li>
