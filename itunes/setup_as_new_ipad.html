<h1 id="setup-as-new-ipad">setup as new ipad?</h1>
<p>we have an existing ipad, have used it for a year, but have never plugged it into a computer here. (it's a school ipad)</p>
<p>we just plugged it in for the first time and were given two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>restore from backup</li>
<li>setup as new ipad</li>
</ol>
<p>We definitely don't want 1. but are worried 2. will wipe the ipad.</p>
<p>Internet research says no, it will not wipe the ipad, it just means that iTunes will now understand and recognise (and be able to backup) this 'new' ipad.</p>
