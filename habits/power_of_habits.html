<h1 id="the-power-of-habits">The Power of Habits</h1>
<p>by Charles Duhigg</p>
<p>This is a well researched and creatively written book. Charles is a journalist who knows how to &quot;craft&quot; a story for high impact. The topic is powerful.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-1-the-habit-loop-how-habits-work">Chapter 1: The Habit Loop - How Habits Work</h3>
<p>Trigger - Routine - Reward.</p>
<p>Once a habit is established, the higher functions and memory are not involved at all. It occurs deep in the brain, close to the brain stem, in the basal ganglia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The trigger can be something tiny. e.g. You have a moment of boredom.</li>
<li>The routine is the act itself, e.g. you smoke a cigarette.</li>
<li>The reward is the payoff, e.g. you're not bored, and your brain gets a little buzz.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that's repeated, a habit becomes ingrained, and you don't consciously think about doing the thing. You just do it.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-the-craving-brain-how-to-create-new-habits">Chapter 2: The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits</h3>
<p>When the reward occurs, the brain has a little burst of activity (possibly dopamine release).</p>
<p>Once the habit is established, the brain will give this dopamine release in anticipation of the reward itself. At that point the habit is a craving. If the reward doesn't arrive, you'll be angry and upset.</p>
<p>Get people to experience the trigger and the reward, the habit will follow. It's easy.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3-the-golden-rule-of-habit-change-why-transformation-occurs">Chapter 3: The Golden Rule of Habit Change - Why Transformation Occurs</h3>
<p>The golden rule is that you can't eradicate the loop (Trigger-Action-Reward). But you can modify it. E.g. swap in a different action, but try to keep the reward the same.</p>
<p>The reward isn't the obvious reward: e.g. crave cigarette, only nicotine will provide the reward. The reward might just be overcoming the boredom of the moment. Finding a tiny pocket of excitement during a dull moment could be enough. An example with fingernail chewing where the person was craving some physical stimulation, so perform acts like rapping her knuckles against a table.</p>
<p>E.g. you like drinking at the pub because of the connection to other people. Then you need to replace the reward with the same reward: have a group of people you're connected to. That's part of what the buddy part of the AA program achieves. Swap in the same reward from a different source.</p>
<p>For a change of habit to really stick (during the hard times) we need something else: we need &quot;belief&quot;. In AA it's expressed as giving yourself up to the Lord. What matters it that you have a deep and unshakable belief that change can occur. i.e. You are deeply hopeful, not hopeless.</p>
