<p>Feedback can have a main purpose of being</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation</li>
<li>Coaching</li>
<li>Appreciation (Compliment/encourage/motivate)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask for feedback, expecting one type and receive another: friction!</p>
<p>If one type was meant (Eg coaching) and another type was perceived (Eg evaluation) then, woah friction!</p>
<p>Try to be clear about which type you want if requesting it</p>
<p>Discuss the purpose of the feedback if giving it (or receiving it)</p>
<p>Clarify what type of feedback they want before you prepare and deliver the feedback.</p>
<p>Be careful when coaching because all coaching includes <em>some</em> evaluation.</p>
<p>Feedback is based on:</p>
<p>Data and interpretation
They give the interpretation without the data. Eg a label without telling you why that label is applicable.</p>
<p>&quot;Wrong&quot; feedback may not be wrong: just different context, interpretation, culture, history, priority, implicit rules, values, definitions. So dig deeper don't reject outright.</p>
<p>Individual variations in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline</li>
<li>Swing</li>
<li>Sustain</li>
<li>Recovery</li>
</ul>
<p>General things:</p>
<p>Criticism is sometimes very specific. Compliments are often vague.</p>
<p>All advice is autobiographical</p>
<p>When lovers peer into each other's eyes they each see a person the other cannot.</p>
<p>In HR we're not happy until you're not happy.</p>
