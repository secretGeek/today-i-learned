<p>Life calling, things larger than ourselves.</p>
<p>People are more motivated when you acknowledge their work.</p>
<p>People overvalue their own output (ie compared to how others value it) &quot;egocentric bias&quot;</p>
<p>People care more when they can put their name on something.</p>
<p>People value their output relative to the effort they've put in.</p>
<p>People are demotivated when their output is destroyed before their eyes.</p>
<p>People are demotivated when their output is ignored.</p>
