<p>Referring to habits as being like a tiny rider on top of an elephant. The rider is your consciousness brain trying to influence the elephant. And the elephant is your habits, your instincts, your unconscious automatic mind.</p>

<li>Sex</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Prestige</li>
<li>Eternal youth</li>
<li>Happiness and</li>

<p>Beliefs are powerful. Example of mindset. Example of placebo medications.</p>
<p>Meaning is an inside job.</p>
<p>Don't work on your resume - work on your eulogy.</p>
