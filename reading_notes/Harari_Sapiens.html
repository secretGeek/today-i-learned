<p>Physics - Chemistry - Biology - Cultures</p>
<p>Revolutions</p>
<p>Cognitive 70,000 years ago</p>
<p>Agricultural 12,000 years ago</p>
<p>Scientific 500 years ago</p>
<p>Humans began 2.5 millions ago</p>
<p>Humans are successful -- because they can organize in large groups -- because they can share belief in intersubjective ideas. Ie shared fictions like gods money laws morals, organizational goals, shared ideals, codes of behavior</p>
<p>Writing evolved first for numbers</p>
<p>Written numbers so useful because the brain can't handle them perfectly</p>
<p>The whole world speaks one language with numbers.</p>
<p>Numbers and maths are a partial script. And they're worldwide. Music is a partial script. It crosses many language boundaries. Partial scripts travel faster than general scripts. DSL's move faster than general purpose languages.</p>
<p>Science got a huge boost from empire building.  Recognizing that science and technology could unlock a new world, scientific expeditions went hand in hand with military conquest.</p>
<p>Modern wars are advanced by technology. The stalemate of the trenches of wwi was broken by technology: tanks, poisons, aerial bombardment</p>
