<h1 id="why-mario-livio">Why? Mario Livio</h1>
<ul>
<li>Epistemic curiosity is the type Einstein had in abundance</li>
<li>Specific curiosity - when u want to know what film that actress was in</li>
<li>Diversive curiosity - restless desire to explore.   Seeking of novel stimulation to avoid boredom. Checking for new email. Impatient etc.</li>
<li>Empathic curiosity - trying to understand a person as in citizen Kane plot</li>
<li>Morbid curiosity - can't look away</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="details-about-leonardo">Details about Leonardo</h2>
<p>He started many more projects than he finished</p>
<p>He was not well read (thankfully! As his experiments were not thus hampered by too many wrong ideas.)</p>
<p>He started by using science to improve his art but finally used art to improve his science.</p>
<p>&quot;Cyberchondria&quot; &quot;a diagnosis based on apparent symptoms that is induced by an internet search&quot;</p>
<p>Novelty can be mapped on these axes:</p>
<p>Specific &lt;---&gt; diversive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A specific thing that once found will satisfy the seeking, or</p>
<p>Diversive: the ceaseless seeking to ward off boredom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perceptual &lt;---&gt; epistemic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perceptual is aroused by surprising novel or ambiguous</p>
<p>Epistemic is the genuine yearning for new knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait - isn't there arousal toward stimulation and secondly satisfaction of the arousal - and you may need to classify it based on both ends of the curiosity arc</p>
<p>Four factors that lead to things being worthy of curiosity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Novelty</li>
<li>Complexity</li>
<li>Uncertainty and</li>
<li>Conflict</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiosity is a cognitive induced deprivation- an information gap</p>
<p>Eg in sudoku we have a clear information gap - small enough that we can fill it and we must fill it</p>
<p>Having filled it a new gap is thus made smaller and within reach - or we believe it is and then we must fill that - and so on.</p>
<p>(Could We model the size of the information gaps at each stage of a game of sudoku, and work out if or when it is maximally satisfying - when are people least likely to lose interest? - and from this develop genetic algorithms that evolve novel games with maximally enjoyable rulesets? Again modeling the human brain in some rudimentary way is an obvious need of such systems. A definition of fun. )</p>
<p>&quot;Everywhere there is a source of food there's some form of life that finds it.&quot; Told to Feynman by his dad in relation to lice on birds whose excretions caused bacteria to blossom</p>
