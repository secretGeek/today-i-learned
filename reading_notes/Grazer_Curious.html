<p>Curiosity conversations with interesting people.</p>
<p>â€œMake the hardest call firstâ€: Eliminates the low grade anxiety. Builds confidence.</p>
<p>Interesting about when not to use curiosity. Sometimes he doesnâ€™t ask questions. When he pitches a movie heâ€™s already decided on and they say no he makes sure itâ€™s a no.  But he doesnâ€™t ask for or want their feedback. Heâ€™s already made a taste decision that he likes the idea of this movie and doesnâ€™t need their two-penny thoughts on how it could be tweaked.</p>
