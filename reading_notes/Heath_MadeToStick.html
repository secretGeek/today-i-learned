<ol>
<li>Simple (core) (simple and profound, proverb like) the commanders intent. The lede. Compact.</li>
<li>Unexpected- surprising interesting violate expectation counter-intuitive make people curios</li>
<li>Concreteness - not abstract, specific, may use concrete metaphors/examples</li>
<li>Credible - can test for yourself, backed with guarantees, authority</li>
<li>Emotions - people must care. An individual over a statistic. Many emotions to choose from: fear resentment compassion disgust</li>
<li>Stories.</li>
</ol>

Step 2: Translate the core using the success checklist.</p>
