<li>Simple (core) (simple and profound, proverb like) the commanders intent. The lede. Compact.</li>
<li>Unexpected- surprising interesting violate expectation counter-intuitive make people curios</li>
<li>Concreteness - not abstract, specific, may use concrete metaphors/examples</li>
<li>Credible - can test for yourself, backed with guarantees, authority</li>
<li>Emotions - people must care. An individual over a statistic. Many emotions to choose from: fear resentment compassion disgust</li>
<li>Stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 step plan.</p>
<p>Step 1: find the core.
Step 2: Translate the core using the success checklist.</p>
<h2 id="core">Core--</h2>
<p>Illustrate the core by saying how it beats adjacent priorities. Eg if you've found the best chicken salad in the world I don't care about it if it interferes with our need to be the best low cost airline.</p>
<h2 id="commanders-intent">Commander's Intent</h2>
<p>Commander's intent was a great example i learned from this book.</p>
<p>The commander has to not only tell people what to do - but summarize the why -- so that when the what goes pear shapeed they can still improvise on achieving the commander's intent.</p>
<p>When you know the commander's intent - you can answer a lot of questions you haven't faced before, without having to ask the boss.</p>
<p>Here's a quote re south west airlines.</p>
<pre><code>I can teach you the secret to running this airline in 30 seconds. This is it: We are THE low-fare airline. Once you understand that fact, you can make any decision about this companyâ€™s future as well as I can.

Tracey, from marketing, comes into your office. She says her surveys indicate that the passengers might enjoy a light entrÃ©e on the Houston to Las Vegas flight. All we offer is peanuts, and she thinks a nice chicken Caesar salad would be popular. â€˜What do you say?â€™

You say â€˜Tracey, will adding the chicken Caesar salad make us THE low-fare airline from Houston to Las Vegas? Because if it doesnâ€™t help us become the unchallenged low-fare airline, weâ€™re not serving any damn chicken saladâ€™.
</code></pre>
<p>-- and apparently Dan and CHip got the quote above from &quot;Buck Up, Suck Up, and Come Back When You Foul Up: 12 Winning Secrets from the War Room, James Carville and Paul Begal&quot;</p>
<p>-- and i found it written down for me already in this medium article: <a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/commanders-intent/">The Commanderâ€™s Intent: How to Make New Habits Stick</a></p>
