<h1 id="hg-push-to-bitbucket-resulted-in-a-rainbow">hg push to bitbucket resulted in a rainbow</h1>
<p><img src="hg_push_resulted_in_this.png" alt="hg_push_resulted_in_this.png" /></p>
<p>This had me completely stumped. What does it mean?</p>
<p>Has bitbucket been hacked? Is my repo corrupted?</p>
<p>After extensive googling I worked out it's an Atlassian logo (atlassian bought bitbucket a few years ago) drawn in rainbow colors, to celebrate equality, on the anniversary of the US Supreme Court's decision to strike down laws against gay marriage.</p>
<p>I wish there'd been a few words, or even a url included. A picture is worth a thousand words, but a few words can be helpful too.</p>
