<p>When trying to pull from bitbucket while behind a corporate firewall i had this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mercurial abort: error: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stackoverflow said I needed to configure a proxy.</p>
<p>Proxy settings are found here:</p>
<pre><code>Internet explorer &gt; Internet options &gt; Connections &gt; LAN Settings
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Local Area Network (LAN) Settings</code> dialog... but proxy server was not specified, instead a <code>Use automatic configuration script</code> was specified.</p>
<p>I downloaded the script that was specified.</p>
<p>It was a lengthy javascript file (800 lines long), starting like this:</p>
<pre><code>function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
	hostIP = dnsResolve(host);
	var tmpURL = url.substr(0,10);

	if(tmpURL.indexOf('://') == -1)
	{
			 url='http://' + url;
	}
</code></pre>
<p>Near the end it told you the general proxy settings to use....</p>
<pre><code>if (shExpMatch(url, &quot;https://*&quot;))
{
	return &quot;PROXY machinename1.adomain:8080; PROXY machinename2.adomain:8080;&quot;;
}
else
{
	return &quot;PROXY machinename1.adomain:8080; PROXY machinename2.adomain:8080;&quot;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>(Names have been changed to protect the LAN)</p>
<p>So I took one of the addresses from there and put it into my <a href="mercurial_ini.html">mercurial.ini</a> file like this:</p>
<pre><code>[http_proxy]
host = machinename1.adomain:8080
</code></pre>
<p>Tried <code>hg in</code> again, and it now worked!</p>
<p>I am good at computers today.</p>
