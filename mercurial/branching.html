<p>I've got a <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/branching">detailed tutorial on branching with mercurial</a> but here's just the cheatsheet for branching with mercurial:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>hg branch</td>
<td>Check which branch you're working on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg branch WEAPONISE_SPACE</td>
<td>Create a branch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg push -b . --new-branch</td>
<td>Push only the current branch (which happens to be new</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg push -b .</td>
<td>Push only the current branch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg heads</td>
<td>See if there are any open &quot;heads&quot; (e.g. open branches)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg pull -b . --rebase</td>
<td>Pull just the current branch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg pull -b WEAPONISE_SPACE --rebase</td>
<td>Pull only the contents of a named branch (and merge any local commits you've already made)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg up WEAPONISE_SPACE</td>
<td>Switch to a named branch. So this will update the current working folder to contain the work from the named branch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg commit -Am &quot;committing here!&quot;</td>
<td>Commit to the current branch, while addremoving files</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg commit -m 'Finished Weaponising Space!' --close-branch</td>
<td>Close the current branch (good hygiene)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg up default</td>
<td>Update so that the current branch is now the default branch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hg merge WEAPONISE_SPACE</td>
<td>Merge a named branch into the current branch</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
