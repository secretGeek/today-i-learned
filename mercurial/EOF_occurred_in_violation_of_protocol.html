<h1 id="abort-error_ssl.c504-eof-occurred-in-violation-of-protocol">Abort: error: _ssl.c:504: EOF occurred in violation of protocol</h1>
<p>You may get this error, as I do on &quot;machine 1&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg in
abort: error: _ssl.c:504: EOF occurred in violation of protocol
</code></pre>
<p>with this version of hg:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg --version
Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 2.2.3)
</code></pre>
<p>And this version of python:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python --version
Python 2.7.9	
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Or</strong> you may get this error, as I do on &quot;machine 2&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg in
abort: error: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:661)
</code></pre>
<p>with this version of hg:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg --version
Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 4.6.1)
</code></pre>
<p>...it's not caused by the client's version of mercurial.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen on local actions. It happens when talking to the server. The server in this case is bitbucket.</p>
<p>The cause is this recent change at bitbucket:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/blog/deprecating-tlsv1-tlsv1-1-2018-12-01">Bitbucket: Deprecating TLSv1 and TLSv1.1</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mercurial command line on UNIX-based systems may be affected; please check your version of Python (with <code>python -V</code>). Versions 2.7.9 and later are unaffected, and most versions earlier than 2.7.9 are affected</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have Python 2.7.9 (on windows command line, machine 1) yet I am affected. How so?</p>
<p>Having that version of python doesn't guarantee that's the version that <code>hg.exe</code> is using.</p>
<p>As it says at the page above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upgrade anything that is affected, before 1 December 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How <em>do</em> I upgrade mercurial? The page called <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/UpgradingMercurial">Upgrading Mercurial</a> doesn't tell you how to upgrade mercurial tooling. Instead it gives you notes about some issues that arise when upgrading the version of a repository.</p>
<p>It's quite frustrating actually.</p>
<p>So my decision is: upgrade <code>thg</code> (Tortoise Hg), and see if that takes care of it.</p>
<p>You get it from here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download#Windows">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download#Windows</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing to work out is if I want 32 or 64 bit <code>thg</code>. I run my local thg and observe in Task Manager that it is not marked as a 32 bit program, so infer that it must be 64 bit.</p>
<p>I install that, it's a bit of a worry because I'm installing &quot;over&quot; the old version, not really replacing it...</p>
<p>The installation requires either that I let it restart chrome and explorer.exe, or I reboot. Both are a hassle. I opt for the former, and expect explorer.exe to never come back.</p>
<p>Currently I'm typing into a text editor, while explorer.exe is not running. It's a strange feeling, like i'm floating in the air.</p>
<p>After two restarts I would say I've had <em>mixed</em> success.</p>
<p>Checking the version of mercurial now returns:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg --version

<p>Which probably just means my legacy extensions are no longer supported. But mercurial itself is now at 4.7.1.</p>
<p><code>hg in</code> now works. (THough it also reports all of the error messages from above.</p>
<p>So once I clean up my extensions, I should be ok.</p>
<p>(Update: yep, that worked. I just removed mention of the extensions from mercurial.ini)</p>
<h1 id="fixing-machine-2">Fixing machine 2</h1>
<p>Machine 2 had this error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg in
abort: error: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:661)
</code></pre>
<p>With mercurial 4.6.1.</p>
<p>Ran the install for tortoise hg 4.8.1 -- bringin the machine up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tortoise Hg 4.81</li>
<li>Mercurial-4.8.1</li>
<li>Python-2.7.13</li>
</ul>
<p>Which <em>should</em> be adequate to get past the problem.</p>
<p>But still receive exact same error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; hg in
abort: error: EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:661)
</code></pre>
<p>Okay - after restarting a few times, I resolved it by updating my proxy (in mercurial settings) do a different proxy.</p>
<p>I inspected the corporate script that runs to determine the proxy, and extracted the value from there.</p>
