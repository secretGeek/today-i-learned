<p>To find which revision a file was deleted in, use</p>
<pre><code>hg log --template &quot;{rev}: {file_dels}\n&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>...which outputs file deletion info from every revision. i.e. a list of every revision, and the names of any files that were deleted during that revision (if any)</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>388:
387:
386: TIL/.net-core-MVC/UrlEncode.md TIL/.net-core-MVC/UrlParameter-Optional.md TIL/.net-core-MVC/ip_address.md
385:
384:
383:
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can grep those details to find the deleted file you're interested in, and see when it was deleted.</p>
<p>You can then browse to the specific revision, via tortoise hg, <code>thg.exe</code>.</p>
