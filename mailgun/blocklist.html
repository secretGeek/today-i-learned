<p>I sent a modest amount of bulk email via Mailgun.</p>
<p>When I looked at the mailgun dashboard <a href="https://app.mailgun.com/app/dashboard">https://app.mailgun.com/app/dashboard</a> I saw that some <strong>failures</strong> had been recorded.</p>
<p>I went to the <code>logs</code> page and saw more detail. It seems that some of the recipients' mail servers (particularly Microsoft ones, e.g. live.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com) refused to accept the email and said:</p>

<p>I couldn't delist there because:</p>

<pre><code>An account is required to proceed!	
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>After attempting all of the above I decided to contact mailgun support.</p>
<p>As a preliminary (before lodging a ticket) they said to first try mail-tester. <a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/">https://www.mail-tester.com/</a></p>
<p>This was a good service! They gave me a score of 10/10 though. (Not sure I deserved it)</p>
<p>And had this helpful advice:
You're not fully authenticated
You do not have a DMARC record</p>
<pre><code>	A DMARC policy allows a sender to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and give instruction if neither of those authentication methods passes. Please be sure you have a DKIM and SPF set before using DMARC.
	You do not have a DMARC record, please add a TXT record to your domain _dmarc.yourfirstproduct.com with the following value:

	v=DMARC1; p=none
	Verification details:

	mail-tester.com; dkim=pass (1024-bit key; unprotected) header.d=mg.yourfirstproduct.com header.i=@mg.yourfirstproduct.com header.b=ekymBOx4; dkim-atps=neutral
	mail-tester.com; dmarc=none header.from=yourfirstproduct.com
	mail-tester.com; dkim=pass (1024-bit key; unprotected) header.d=mg.yourfirstproduct.com header.i=@mg.yourfirstproduct.com header.b=ekymBOx4; dkim-atps=neutral
	From Domain: yourfirstproduct.com
	DKIM Domain: mg.yourfirstproduct.com		
	
You're listed in 1 blacklist
	Listed in SORBS (last 28 days) ( -0.5 )

Your message does not contain a List-Unsubscribe head
	The List-Unsubscribe header is required if you send mass emails, it enables the user to easily unsubscribe from your mailing list.
	Your message does not contain a List-Unsubscribe header
</code></pre>
<p>And this confusing advice:</p>
<pre><code>Your message could be improved
	Weight of the HTML version of your message: 1KB.
	Your message contains 75% of text.
</code></pre>
<p>So I could add DMARC and potentially add a List-Unsubscribe header. I hadn't heard of that before. So it's good to learn about something.</p>
<p>I looked into how this is done, and it's not as simple as it ought to be. Given that I have a unique https'd URL they can 'get' to be unsubscribed, I thought it's just be a matter of feeding this to a parameter of the API call for mailgun. But alas, they want to &quot;add value&quot; by managing the unsubscribe functionality.</p>
<p>Here's the ticket I raised at <a href="https://app.mailgun.com/app/support/new">https://app.mailgun.com/app/support/new</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Hello I would like to request:

IP rotation due to blacklisting

IP: 
104.130.122.16

Message: 
5.7.1 Unfortunately, messages from [104.130.122.16] weren't sent. Please contact your Internet service provider since part of their network is on our block list (S3150). You can also refer your provider to http://mail.live.com/mail/troubleshooting.aspx#errors. [HE1EUR02FT024.eop-EUR02.prod.protection.outlook.com]

I checked at mxtoolbox and found the mailgun IP on 4 separate blacklists. This pre-dated my sending of emails, it goes back weeks and weeks. I tried to get it unblocked from all of them. I may have succeeded with 2, but couldn't succeed with all of them.

please rotate my IP address if possible.

Is there anything I need to do on my end, with DNS etc?

kind regards
Leon Bambrick

<p>...And I attached the images from above.</p>
<p>This may have been overkill, by about 1000% percent, but I don't want to have to email them twice. And since I'm recording what I wrote I can reuse it later.</p>
