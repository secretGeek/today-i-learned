<p>We can see that the post was closed with Reason 102 which means 'Off Topic'
But there is no information here about which OffTopic Reasons.</p>
<p>(if you visit the question you'll see that the OffTopic reason was
&quot;Questions asking us to recommend or find a tool, library or
favorite off-site resource are off-topic&quot;)</p>
<pre><code>Select
 p.Id as [Post Link],
 pf.*
from Posts p
inner join PendingFlags pf on pf.PostId = p.Id
where p.Id = 17335689

--0 rows. No &quot;Pending Flags&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I think I've found that 'PendingFlags' only exist for questions that are pending closure, not for closed questions.
It's a shame because this table has the promising 'CloseAsOffTopicReasonTypeId'
that I am chasing.</p>
<pre><code>Select

--3 rows. 2 down votes 1 upvote. No clue here about off topic sub reason.

<p>This shows details of a review.
There was a review, it was completed, it has a result,
the result was that the question was closed.
But this doesn't tell us the close reason sub types either!</p>
