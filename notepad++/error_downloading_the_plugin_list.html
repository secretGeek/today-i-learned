<h1 id="resolved-there-was-an-error-downloading-the-plugin-list">Resolved: There was an error downloading the plugin list.</h1>
<p>I decided to try once again to use the plugin manager to get the <a href="install_textfx_plugin.html">TextFX Characters plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Ran Plugin Manager... it needed to be updated.</p>
<p>After the update:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has ads: &quot;Plugin list hosting generously provided by&quot; (some business I'd like to DDOS)</li>
</ol>
<p>And message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an error downloading the plugin list. Please check your internet connection, and your proxy settings in Internet Explorer, Edge or Chrome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we went backwards.</p>
<p>I changed the setting that says &quot;Force HTTP instead of HTTPS for downloading Plugin List&quot;. Restarted Notepad++ and was then able to download the plugin list and install the TextFX Characters plugin.</p>
