<h1 id="the-one-where-i-had-to-write-my-own-toolstripitemrenderer-to-get-around-a-closed-wont-fix-bug-in-windows-forms">The one where I had to write my own ToolstripItemRenderer to get around a 'closed won't fix' bug in Windows Forms</h1>
<p>Breakdown of time spent adding a new feature in <a href="http://nimbletext.com/SET/About/">NimbleSET</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time spent writing the feature (implementing natural join, absolute joins, and a hierarchy of possible column joins) 3 hours.</li>
<li>Time Spent getting Tooltips and tab order correct and consistent: 1 hour.</li>
<li>Time spent working around a bug in the framework that was resolved as 'closed, won't fix' in 2006. 4 hours. (details below).</li>
<li>Time spent blogging about it and subsequently finding other improvements to the code: 1 hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the bug in the framework is that if a <code>toolbarstrip</code> has large icons (e.g. <code>ToolStrip.ImageScalingSize = new Size(32, 32);</code>), then 'Checked' items won't render correctly in a child dropdown list of that <code>toolbarstrip</code>. Obscure? Yep.</p>
<p><img src="toolstrip_renderer_checkitem_wrong.png" alt="checked items checkmark renders misaligned" /></p>
<p>(See the clipped checkmark next to the word 'Natural' that is rendered in the wrong place? That's why shipping software is hard.)</p>
<p>It's obscure enough that it got <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/196480/toolstrip-dropdown-buttons-scale-images-checkboxes-incorrectly-with-toolstrip-imagescalingsize-32x32">0 upvotes and 0 repros</a> on Connect. The workaround provided there wasn't enough to solve it properly. (Incidentally when I visit that page now I get a 400 error, but when i visit from an incognito browser it works... so I suspect I'm sending like a billion old cookies or something...)</p>
<p>What I needed to do was write my own <code>ToolStripProfessionalRenderer</code>, and override the <code>OnRenderItemCheck</code> method.</p>
<p>If you want to create your own renderer, avoid the advice that says to inherit from <code>ToolStripRenderer</code>, you want to inherit from <code>ToolStripProfessionalRenderer</code> instead, like so:</p>
<pre><code>public class CustomToolStripRenderer : System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripProfessionalRenderer
{
}
</code></pre>
<p>And be sure to tell your control that you want to use your custom renderer, like this:</p>
<pre><code>mainToolStrip.Renderer = new CustomToolStripRenderer();
        
</code></pre>
<p>Then within the custom renderer, you can override whichever method you're unhappy with.</p>
<p>Here's the code I wrote to draw a little blue box, and a custom tick, that should be a pixel-perfect representation of the intended one. I just know there are going to be edge cases (e.g. custom DPI) that will break this.</p>
<pre><code>protected override void OnRenderItemCheck(ToolStripItemImageRenderEventArgs e)
{
    var g = e.Graphics;
    var fillColor = (e.Item.Selected ? this.ColorTable.CheckSelectedBackground : this.ColorTable.CheckBackground);  
    g.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(fillColor), new Rectangle(3, 1, 19, 19)); 
    g.DrawRectangle(new Pen(new SolidBrush(this.ColorTable.ButtonCheckedHighlightBorder), 1), new Rectangle(3, 1, 19, 19));
    // Draw the check mark. (two lines)
    g.DrawLines(System.Drawing.Pens.Black, new Point[] { new Point(10, 9), new Point(12, 11), new Point(16, 7) });
    g.DrawLines(System.Drawing.Pens.Black, new Point[] { new Point(10, 10), new Point(12, 12), new Point(16, 8) });
    // base.OnRenderItemCheck(e); &lt;-- **don't** let the base do its own rendering.
}
</code></pre>
<p>But it got the job done, and allowed me to use the dormant GDI+ neurons I developed long ago.</p>
