<h1 id="operation-is-blocked-by-software-restriction-policies">operation is blocked by software restriction policies</h1>
<p>On loading my <a href="create_profile.html">profile</a> on a new machine, as a mortal account, I would suffer this problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File cannot be loaded because its operation is blocked by software restriction policies, such as those created by using Group Policy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When running as admin I did not get the same issue.</p>
<p>When running as a mortal account:</p>
<pre><code>Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
</code></pre>
<p>...showed me that the execution policy was <code>RemoteSigned</code></p>
<p>Right clicking on the file in explorer, and viewing properties, I expected to see an &quot;Unblock&quot; button -- but there was no such button.</p>
<p>The trick was... it was a 0 byte file! It had been created but never populated. So I deleted the file, and all was good.</p>
