<h1 id="avoid-access-is-denied-when-using-powershell-remoting-to-copy-to-a-shared-network-folder-i.e.defeating-kerberos">Avoid 'access is denied' when using Powershell Remoting to Copy to a Shared Network Folder (i.e. Defeating Kerberos)</h1>
<p><strong>Scenario</strong> You are using remoting, and have assigned credentials to the remoting session...</p>
<p>Within the remote session block you are trying to talk a network fileshare, but failing with Access Denied. (<code>UnauthorizedAccessException</code>)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>$Credentials = Get-Credential -Message &quot;Provide the credentials for remote access&quot; # prompts for credentials
$TargetServer = &quot;YourServer&quot;
$PSSessionOption = New-PSSessionOption -ProxyAccessType NoProxyServer
$RemoteSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $TargetServer -Credential $Credentials -SessionOption $PSSessionOption

$TargetFolder = &quot;\\OtherServer\ShareName\Pathy\Path&quot;
write-host &quot;THIS WON'T WORK...&quot; -f red
Invoke-Command -Session $RemoteSession {

	# This works: we can view local folders on machine
	dir; 
	
	# This doesn't work: we cannot authenticate to view restricted network shares
	dir $using:TargetFolder
}
</code></pre>
<p>But it errors with &quot;Access is Denied&quot;</p>
<p>You can't believe it, because when you remote onto the same machine with Remote Desktop Connection Manager (etc) and run the same command in powershell, with the exact same user -- you <em>do</em> have permission!</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>It <strong>kerberos</strong> of course! It's always kerberos!</p>
<p>Those credentials are being quietly refused to be passed along to the second machine -- so it just don't matter.</p>
<p>Instead -- do this...</p>
<pre><code>$Credentials = Get-Credential -Message &quot;Provide the credentials for remote access&quot; # prompts for credentials
$TargetServer = &quot;YourServer&quot;
$PSSessionOption = New-PSSessionOption -ProxyAccessType NoProxyServer
$RemoteSession = New-PSSession -ComputerName $TargetServer -Credential $Credentials -SessionOption $PSSessionOption

$TargetFolder = &quot;\\OtherServer\ShareName\Pathy\Path&quot;


write-host &quot;HOW ABOUT THESE APPLES...&quot; -f green
Invoke-Command -Session $RemoteSession {
	# This still works: we can view local folders on machine
	dir; 
	
	# NOW, we create a new PS-Drive to the share. (You can give it a nice name, not just one letter). 
	# And provide the credential to it!
	new-psdrive  -name &quot;MyNewDrive&quot; -root $using:TargetFolder -PSProvider &quot;FileSystem&quot; -Credential $using:Credentials | out-null
	dir &quot;MyNewDrive:\&quot;
	remove-psdrive &quot;MyNewDrive&quot;
	# ^^ Remember to remove it... (though it will dissappear anyway if it doesn't have a &quot;-persist&quot; flag)
}
</code></pre>
<p>...i.e. create a new drive, and pass the credentials in when creating that drive... and then use that new drive name, instead of the UNC path of the share.</p>
<h2 id="historical-note">Historical Note</h2>
<p>We were actually trying to copy a file, not just view a directory.</p>
<p>And here's something we tried along the way that failed -- but gave an error message with a hint that taught us the ps drive trick!!</p>
<pre><code>Invoke-Command -Session $remoteSession {
	copy $using:SourceFile $using:TargetFolder -credential $using:Credentials
}
</code></pre>
<p>...the error message said</p>
<pre><code>The FileSystem provider supports credentials only on the New-PSDrive cmdlet. Perform the operation again without specifying credentials.
	+ CategoryInfo          : NotImplemented: (:) [], PSNotSupportedException
	+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : NotSupported
	+ PSComputerName        : YourServer.YourDomain.com
</code></pre>
<p>What a sneaky message!</p>
<p>The command we're using (copy... really it's copy-item) <em>has</em> a <code>credential</code> parameter. But with the underlying provider (<code>FileSystem</code>) -- it throws this message.</p>
<p>It's really giving you a clue about how to achieve the workaround. So even though they say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perform the operation again without specifying credentials</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...what they've helped us to &quot;think&quot; is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use <code>New-PsDrive</code> with your credential to make a new, temporary, PsDrive, and then use <em>that</em> PsDrive to achieve your File Operation!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Big thanks to Paul Gaske for developing this as we paired on it. He has a lot of very neat powershell bits n pieces.</p>
