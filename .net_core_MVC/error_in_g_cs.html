<p>Sometimes, particularly after upgrading from one .net core verison to another I see errors in <code>g.cshtml.cs</code> pages...</p>
<pre><code>Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Error	CS0246	The type or namespace name 'VerifyCodeViewModel' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)	mysite	C:\apps\websites\mysite\obj\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\Razor\Views\Account\VerifyCode.g.cshtml.cs	23	Active
</code></pre>
<p>I can never remember what to do.</p>
<p>The trick is to go and look at the <code>cshtml</code> file (the razor view itself) that the <code>.cs</code> file is compiled from.</p>
<p>There will be an error and it will be evident in the cshtml file itself.</p>
<p>For some of them the error was that I had to add another <code>@using</code> statement to the <code>_ViewImports.cshtml</code> file. But it could be anything.</p>
