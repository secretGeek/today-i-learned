<p>Quick note on any utils, (where note is too brief to warrant a whole file)</p>
<h2 id="capturing-animated-gifs">Capturing animated gifs</h2>
<p>Two super simple apps for this, LICEcap and gifcam.  Gifcam (from <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/</a>) lets you edit/remove frames.</p>
<h2 id="hard-drive-space-squarified-treemap">Hard drive space -- squarified treemap</h2>
<p>SpaceSniffer is my current go to tool for working out where all your hard drive space went. Previously used SpaceMonger, and at one time used SequoiaView.</p>
<p>I noticed recently that the industry favorite WinDirStat also includes a squarified treemap.</p>
