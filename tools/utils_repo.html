<h1 id="have-a-utils-repo">Have a utils repo</h1>
<p>I have a utils repo and you should too.</p>
<p>It is a private repository that I clone onto any machine I use.</p>
<p>It is on the <a href="../powershell/PATH.html">PATH</a> of the machine, so its contents are always available.</p>
<p>Why must it be a private repo? Because I don't have permission to redistribute all of the files.</p>
<p>(Private repos are <strong>free</strong> at <a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket</a> but not free at github.)</p>
<p>In the utils repo I keep:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the &quot;<a href="list_of_tools.html">little tools</a>&quot; I expect to be available and in the PATH on each machine</li>
<li>My powershell profile and powershell scripts</li>
<li>Handy LinqPad scripts</li>
<li>My 'Today I learned' notes -- it's where they are originally written, in a folder called TIL.
(I also have a git repo which grabs that TIL folder, and publishes it as a gitbook at <a href="http://TIL.secretGeek.net">http://TIL.secretGeek.net</a>)</li>
</ol>
