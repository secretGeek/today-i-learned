<h1 id="converting-survey-responses-to-numbers-in-excel">Converting survey responses to numbers in excel</h1>
<p>You've received a lot of survey data and it might have a column that says good, very good, poor etc -- and you want to turn it into numbers.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Response</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Never</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Occasionally</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sometimes</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Often</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There's a bunch of different ways to solve this problem and they all look super nerdy.</p>
<p>Some nerds would say &quot;use a Vlookup&quot; and others would argue &quot;use an index match&quot; and others &quot;use a switch function&quot; -- all of these are powerful and fun and odd looking.</p>
<p>The &quot;simplest&quot; way is half as complex as those but still pretty nerdy.</p>
<p>Here's an example data - and what we want to achieve:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>+</th>
<th>A</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>C</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>Person</strong></td>
<td><strong>Feeling</strong></td>
<td><strong>Score</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Maria</td>
<td>Sometimes</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Jack</td>
<td>Never</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Joan</td>
<td>Occasionally</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Terry</td>
<td>Sometimes</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Dave</td>
<td>Occasionally</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We have the answers that the person selected, but we don't yet have the Score. When we're doing it will look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>+</th>
<th>A</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>C</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><strong>Person</strong></td>
<td><strong>Feeling</strong></td>
<td><strong>Score</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Maria</td>
<td>Sometimes</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Jack</td>
<td>Never</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Joan</td>
<td>Occasionally</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Terry</td>
<td>Sometimes</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Dave</td>
<td>Occasionally</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To perform the scoring, I wrote a &quot;function&quot; -- a piece of text that starts with the equals sign '='</p>
<p>The function i wrote was this, i.e. here's what it says in <code>C2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>=IF(B2=&quot;Never&quot;,1,IF(B2=&quot;Occasionally&quot;,2,IF(B2=&quot;Sometimes&quot;,3,IF(B2=&quot;Often&quot;,4,IF(B2=&quot;Always&quot;,5)))))
</code></pre>
<p>It's a &quot;nested if&quot; function. Nested because there are brackets &quot;nested&quot; inside brackets.</p>
<p>A &quot;nested if&quot; function is a function that is so ugly only it's mother could love it.</p>
<p>But because it's been around forever and because Excel will outlast everything else on earth -- it's not a bad investment of time to go through it super super slow, let it wash over you and begin to bask in its majesty.</p>
<p>We wrote that function in <code>C2</code></p>
<p>When you copy and paste it from row 2 into row 3, excel magically rewrote all of the 2's into 3's ... and the function updated for me.</p>
<p>(And sometimes you don't want it to do that -- there's a different trick to stop it from doing that.)</p>
<p>Also -- it is totally normal and expected that you'll get lost in all the commas and closing brackets..... you'll see this kind of error message at times:</p>
<p><img src="words_to_numbers_error.png" alt="words to numbers error" /></p>
<p>I took a screenshot of that error when it happened to me earlier. I think i'd left out one of the &quot;)&quot; -- at the end ..... -- i just shared that so you know it's normal to get errors a lot.</p>
<p>90% of the books in computer science are about trying to re-think our lives such that we don't end up with complex nested if expressions.</p>
<p>Now you can use that function in all sorts of places, and if you take your time you can write them for any of these survey questions.</p>
