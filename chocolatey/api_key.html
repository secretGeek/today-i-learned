<h1 id="how-to-generate-find-and-use-a-chocolatey-api-key">How to generate, find and use a chocolatey API Key</h1>
<p>(Useful if you are publishing a package)</p>
<p>(This is a made up APIkey for example purposes... if it happens to be yours I am sorry, and quite surprised) -- fddb4ab2-3149-3620-c89d-18aca1c87a55</p>
<p>To generate or find your chocolatey api key, go to: <a href="https://chocolatey.org/account">https://chocolatey.org/account</a></p>
<p>There you will see a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>choco apikey --key fddb4ab2-3149-3620-c89d-18aca1c87a55 --source https://push.chocolatey.org/
</code></pre>
<p>The first command sets the apikey you are using for a given source. It is encrypted, encoded and stored in your chocolatey config file, here:</p>
<pre><code>C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\config\chocolatey.config
</code></pre>
<p>Which will say something like...</p>
<pre><code>&lt;chocolatey&gt;
&lt;apiKeys&gt;
	&lt;apiKeys source=&quot;https://push.chocolatey.org/&quot; key=&quot;Huge nasty base64 encoded encrypted apikey&quot;
	/&gt;
  &lt;/apiKeys&gt;
&lt;/chocolatey&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Earlier I was getting this error message:</p>
<pre><code>ACTION: Please update your apikey to use
  'https://push.chocolatey.org/'
 instead of
  'https://chocolatey.org/'.
 The latter source url is now considered deprecated and will not be
 checked as the default source in Chocolatey v1.0. For details, run
 `choco apikey -?`
</code></pre>
<p>I read the help at <code>choco apikey -?</code> and read everything online... it was only when I went to <code>https://chocolatey.org/account</code> and found that command above, including my apikey, and ran it... that the problem was resolved.</p>
