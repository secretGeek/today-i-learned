<h1 id="appharbor-keep-alive">AppHarbor Keep alive</h1>
<p>My sample app on AppHarbor is very slow to start up — but lickety split when it's running.</p>
<p>You can use &quot;background workers&quot; at appHarbor to run console apps that perform actions such as keeping the site warm, rebuilding indexes etc. See for example <a href="http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/01/keeping-your-appharbor-application-pool.html">http://www.jefclaes.be/2013/01/keeping-your-appharbor-application-pool.html</a> and <a href="https://support.appharbor.com/kb/getting-started/background-workers">https://support.appharbor.com/kb/getting-started/background-workers</a> — but these are not available on the free plan, so you are looking at $49 a month minimum.</p>
<p>So instead I'm using <a href="https://www.statuscake.com/">StatusCake</a> — free plan — to ping a particular URL (<a href="http://guessaguid.apphb.com/api/leaderboard">http://guessaguid.apphb.com/api/leaderboard</a>) on the application every 5 minutes. This should keep the app pool alive and responsive.</p>
<p>My experience so far is that the application is kept alive and remains very responsive.</p>
