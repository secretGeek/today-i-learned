<h1 id="renew-certificates-in-a.net-project-on-windows">Renew certificates in a .net project on windows</h1>
<p>When you create an asp.net web application and develop it in visual studio, it also creates self signed certificates (a PEM and a Key) file stored in <code>$ENV:APPDATA\ASP.NET\Https</code>.</p>
<p>For example, a solution called <code>Project1</code> might create files called:</p>
<pre><code>$ENV:APPDATA\ASP.NET\Https\project1.client.key
$ENV:APPDATA\ASP.NET\Https\project1.client.pem
</code></pre>
<p>These will have an expiry of one year.</p>
<p>One year later they will need to be renewed.</p>
<p>If things go well, this may happen automatically. Perhaps visual studio will prompt you to make sure it's ok. I don't know.</p>
<p>The only thing I know about it what it feels like when it goes <em>wrong</em>. It gets very confusing. You've changed nothing, and yet a project that worked yesterday does not work today.</p>
<p>Allegedly you can run</p>
<pre><code>dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
</code></pre>
<p>But the solution that worked for me was to delete the files and re-load the project in visual studio, so they would be re-created.</p>
<p>Actually, it's less drastic than that. I didn't <strong>delete</strong> the files, I &quot;zz'd&quot; them: I renamed them to have a &quot;zz_&quot; prefix at the staert of their name, so that they would not be found. That's it.</p>
<p>Then, when I restarted visual studio I found that new files had been created.</p>
<h2 id="some-notes-on-diagnosis">Some notes on diagnosis</h2>
<p>i could see that there was an allegedly expired  certificate by looking at the certificate warning in Chrome or Edge.</p>
<p>I found the name of the certificate file(s) by looking at the config for &quot;vite&quot;.</p>
<p>In <code>vite.config.ts</code> I could see it was looking in <code>$ENV:Appdata/ASP.NET/https/</code> for a specific <code>.pem</code> and <code>.key</code> file.</p>
<p>So I went to that folder, and saw a bunch of files, with <code>.pfx</code>, <code>.pem</code> and <code>.key</code> file types. The relevant ones, named after my problem project, were easy to spot.</p>
<h2 id="inspect-certificates">Inspect certificates</h2>
<p>Also -- you can inspect the relevant certificates, from powershell, by running this query, which looks in the <code>Cert:</code> Powershell drive.</p>
<pre><code>Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My | Where-Object { $_.Subject -like '*localhost*' } | select -prop *
</code></pre>
