<p>If anyone is reporting that your product is a virus, then virus total will know about it</p>

<p>One company was flagging NimbleText as a virus. I found out who via Virus Total.</p>
<p>I emailed them (the problem company, not virus total) and they corrected the issue within a day.</p>
<p>Here's a page that lists how to contact a large number of Antivirus vendors:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.virus-removal-help.com/how-to-report-false-positives-to-antivirus-vendors/">How to Report False Positives to Antivirus Vendors</a></p>
<p>&quot;Rising&quot; was particularly hard to track down. I found this page: <a href="http://mailcenter.rising.com.cn/filecheck_en/">http://mailcenter.rising.com.cn/filecheck_en/</a></p>
<p>If your webpage is flagged as containing malware that's a different problem. See Google Search Console tip.</p>
