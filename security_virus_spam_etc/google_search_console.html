<p>#Is your website flagged as containing malware?</p>
<p>google search console (formerly google webmaster tools) tells you if there's any spam/malware on your sites.</p>
<p>for example i received this warning:</p>
<pre><code>Hacked content detected on http://timesnapper.com/
</code></pre>
<p>found the problem, found the cause, fixed it, wrote to google and they stopped penalizing my site.</p>
