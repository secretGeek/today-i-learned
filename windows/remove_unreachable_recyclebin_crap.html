<h1 id="remove-unreachable-recycle-bin-crap">Remove unreachable recycle bin crap</h1>
<p>On a networked (work) computer that has been used by a lot of other users, I was running low on hard drive space.</p>
<p>Running spacesniffer (as admin) I saw that there were 26+ GB of files under <code>C:\$Recycle.Bin</code> -- even though I had already emptied the hard drive.</p>
<p>I reasoned that these were things the other users had put in the recycle bin. Or the recycle bin was in some way corrupted.</p>
<p>I don't care why -- I just need lots of space in a hurry to complete a task with a tight deadline.</p>
<p>The solution</p>
<p>from an <strong>elevated</strong> command prompt and then</p>
<pre><code>rd /s/q c:\$Recycle.Bin
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;rd /s/q c:\$Recycle.Bin
The directory is not empty.

C:\&gt;rd /s/q c:\$Recycle.Bin
</code></pre>
<p>(I had to run it twice.)</p>
