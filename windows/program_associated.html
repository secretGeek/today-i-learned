<p>Of all the random alerts that Windows shows, this is one of the most annoying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="./program_associated.png" alt="Program associated" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This file</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which file?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does not have a program associated with it</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>for performing this action.</p>

<p>Please install a program</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
