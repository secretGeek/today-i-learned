<p>First, assume we have a query that shows us the value of sales and the number of sales in each state....</p>
<pre><code>Select
	s.State
	Sum(s.Amount) as Amount,
	Count(*) as Number_of_Sales
from 
	Sales s
Group by s.State
</code></pre>
<p>Now the boss asks you to include the name of the salesperson with the most sales in each state....</p>
<p>You decide to use a subquery in the select. It looks a bit wonky but it gets the job done:</p>
<pre><code>Select
	s.State,
	Sum(s.Amount) as Amount,
	Count(*) as s.Number_of_Sales,
	BestSalesperson = (Select top(1) Salesperson from Sales where State = s.State group by Salesperson order by Sum(Amount) desc) 
from 
	Sales s
Group by s.State
</code></pre>
<p>Great -- now the boss asks you to throw in the amount of sales that the lead salesperson had.</p>
<p>You scratch your head and decide to repeat the same subquery you'd already used....</p>
<pre><code>Select
	s.State,
	Sum(s.Amount) as Amount,
	Count(*) as s.Number_of_Sales,
	BestSalesperson = (Select top(1) Salesperson from Sales where State = s.State group by Salesperson order by Sum(Amount) desc),
    BestSalesperson_Sales = (Select top(1) Sum(Amount) from Sales where State = s.State group by Salesperson order by Sum(Amount) desc) 
from 
	Sales s
Group by s.State
</code></pre>
<p>But is there a better way?</p>
<p>Yes there is!</p>
<p>You could've used an OUTER APPLY.... watch</p>
<pre><code>Select
	s.State,
	Sum(s.Amount) as Amount,
	Count(*) as s.Number_of_Sales,
	so.SalesPerson as BestSalesperson,
    so.SalesAmount as BestSalesperson_Sales
from 
	Sales s
outer apply (Select top (1) 
		Salesperson, 
		Sum(Amount) as SalesAmount 
	from 
		Sales 
	where 
		State = s.State 
	Group by 
		SalesPerson 
	order by 
		Sum(Amount) desc) so
Group by State, so.SalesPerson, so.SalesAmount
</code></pre>
<p>Outer apply is just the trick.</p>
<p>It lets you create a table that refers to any other table in the query, without having to perform a regular join.</p>
<p>I suppose there are better examples to be created, but I haven't thought of one just yet.</p>
