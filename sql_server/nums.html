<h1 id="nums-table-in-sql-server-a-table-of-numbers">Nums Table in SQL Server - a table of numbers</h1>
<p>For various purposes, it can be helpful to have a &quot;nums&quot; table in your SQL Server database. This is simply a table, with (for example) one column, called 'num', and perhpas <code>10,000</code> or <code>100,000</code> rows, simply containing the integers from <code>1</code> to <code>10,000</code> (or <code>100,000</code> as the case may be.)</p>
<p>One particular use for it is when you wish to aggregate (for example) the &quot;Daily Sales Total&quot; -- and you group sales values by the date, all seems good. But soon you realise there are some dates with no sales. You would like to have a value of &quot;0&quot; for those days, rather than just omit the row from your results.</p>
<p>So you will instead join first with a Common Table Expression of dates, that uses the <code>nums</code> table as its backbone --</p>
<pre><code>with Days as (
		select
		num,
		DateAdd(d, num*-1, DATEADD(DAY, DATEDIFF(DAY, 0, GETDATE()), 0)) as [Date] from nums
		where num &lt;= 31 and num &gt; 1
	)
</code></pre>
<p>But to do this -- you must first create and populate your nums table.</p>
<p>There are many many different scripts for this, with various performance characteristics or limitations.</p>
<p>Here is one -- it is based on &quot;Method5&quot; from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1407488/49">this excellent stack overflow answer</a>:</p>
<pre><code>-- DROP TABLE Nums
CREATE TABLE Nums (Num  int  not null)  
;WITH
	Pass0 as (select 1 as C union all select 1), --2 rows
	Pass1 as (select 1 as C from Pass0 as A, Pass0 as B),--4 rows
	Pass2 as (select 1 as C from Pass1 as A, Pass1 as B),--16 rows
	Pass3 as (select 1 as C from Pass2 as A, Pass2 as B),--256 rows
	Pass4 as (select 1 as C from Pass3 as A, Pass3 as B),--65536 rows
	--I removed Pass5, since I'm only populating the Nums table to 10,000
	Tally as (select row_number() over(order by C) as Num from Pass4)
INSERT Nums
		(Num)
	SELECT Num
		FROM Tally
		WHERE Num &lt;= 10000
ALTER TABLE Nums ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Nums PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (Num)
	
SELECT COUNT(*) as [Number of Numbers in Nums Table] FROM Nums
</code></pre>
<p>Mothers, tell your children, not to do what I have done, to spend your life, in sql misery, optimizing nums tables generation, for fun.</p>
