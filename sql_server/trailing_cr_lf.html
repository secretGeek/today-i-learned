<h1 id="trailing-cr-lf">Trailing Cr Lf</h1>
<p>Trailing Carriage return (\r) and Linefeed (\n) in a varchar are really hard to detect in SSMS.</p>
<p>Imagine there's three columns, A, B and C that have the same content except B has two trailing spaces and C has a trailing '\r\n'.</p>
<pre><code>Select A,B,C from Table
</code></pre>
<p>In SSMS the grid will silently turn the '\r\n' into two spaces.</p>
<p>So it will look like B and C both have two trailing spaces.</p>
<p>If you compare A=B it will return <code>true</code> (because 'A' == 'A  ' according to SQL)</p>
<p>If you compare B=C (or A=C) it will return 'false' -- even though A and B will both look (in the grid) like they have trailing spaces.</p>
<p>If you switch the output to text mode, the carriage return line feed will be retained.</p>
