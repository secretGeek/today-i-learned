<h1 id="mismatch-between-estimated-and-actual-number-of-rows-returned-in-execution-plan">Mismatch between estimated and actual number of rows returned in Execution Plan.</h1>
<p>If you have mismatch between estimated and actual number of rows returned in a SQL Server Execution Plan, the classic advice is that &quot;your statistics may be out of date.&quot;</p>
<p>By default, statistics are configured to be updated automatically, and SQL Server's pretty smart about it.</p>
<h1 id="actual-smaller-than-estimated">Actual smaller than estimated:</h1>
<p>Kendra Little gives a counter example in the article <a href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2013/08/query-plans-what-happens-when-row-estimates-get-high/">Query Plans: Memory Grants and High Row Estimates</a> where she shows that using functions in your predicates can make SQL Server pessimistic about the expected number of matches, which in turn causes <code>estimated</code> to be much greater than <code>actual</code>, consuming unneccessary resources etc.</p>
<h1 id="actual-larger-than-estimated">Actual LARGER than estimated:</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/Topic513086-360-1.aspx">Grant Fritchey says</a> that when  a table valued function, particularly a multi-statement function, is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the optimizer doesn't and can't know what to do with that when it's designing the execution plan, so it creates a plan for a one row table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GSquared, in that same thread, adds that <strong>Table variables</strong> and <strong>Recursive CTEs</strong> are both often estimated at 1 row, though the actual may be higher.</p>
