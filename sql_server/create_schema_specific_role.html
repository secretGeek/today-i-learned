<h1 id="create-a-role-that-gives-a-user-permissions-on-a-specific-schema">Create a role that gives a user permissions on a specific schema.</h1>
<p>Creates a role named 'SpecificSchemaSuperPowers'</p>
<p>That gives specific permissions (ALTER, DELETE, EXECUTE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT, UPDATE, VIEW DEFINITION) on a specific schema 'SpecificSchema'</p>
<p>(And adds a particular user (AD\BambrickL) to that role)</p>
<p>as follows:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE ROLE SpecificSchemaSuperPowers AUTHORIZATION dbo;

GRANT ALTER, DELETE, EXECUTE, INSERT, REFERENCES, SELECT,
          UPDATE, VIEW DEFINITION ON SCHEMA::SpecificSchema TO SpecificSchemaSuperPowers;
</code></pre>
<p>And grant those powers, I mean assign that role, to a user or group:</p>
<pre><code>EXEC sp_addrolemember 'SpecificSchemaSuperPowers', 'AD\BambrickL';
</code></pre>
<p>For a &quot;reporting-only&quot; role, on a single schema called MyReportingSchema...</p>
<pre><code>CREATE ROLE ReportingRole AUTHORIZATION dbo;

GRANT EXECUTE, REFERENCES, SELECT,
          VIEW DEFINITION ON SCHEMA::MyReportingSchema TO ReportingRole;
</code></pre>
<p>And grant those powers, I mean assign that role, to a user or group:
Then add the relevant group or user to that role:</p>
<pre><code>EXEC sp_addrolemember 'ReportingRole', 'AD\ReportingUser';
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dynamic-sql-for-a-limited-rights-user">Dynamic SQL for a limited rights user</h2>
<p>Next challenge is that for very rare but perfectly acceptable reasons, there is a stored procedure in the <code>MyReportingSchema</code> schema, that needs to execute some dynamic sql (with sp_executesql), which selects from other tables in another schema.</p>
<p>(<strong>Yes I protected against sql injection.</strong> I feel I'm safe here because the only dynamic part of the sql, is some integers, which I validate as being integers and in a good range, before I proceed. I can't see a way to sneak any other user data into the query.)</p>
<p>Problem: Dynamic SQL gets run in a different context to the caller. So even though the callers was allowed to execute the stored procedure, they are not allowed to run the <em>dynamic</em> sql (it calls a table they can't access.)</p>
<p>This is a sample of code (from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms187051(v=sql.105)?redirectedfrom=MSDN">BOL</a> that shows how the inner context and out context are different:</p>
<pre><code>PRINT 'Outside Dynamic SQL Execution:';
SET ARITHABORT ON;
SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON;
PRINT 1/0;
PRINT '---------------------------------';

PRINT 'Inside Dynamic SQL Execution:';
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);
SET @SQL = 'SET ARITHABORT OFF;
			SET ANSI_WARNINGS OFF;
			PRINT 1/0;
			PRINT ''---------------------------------'';'
EXECUTE sp_executesql @SQL;

PRINT 'Back outside Dynamic SQL Execution:';
PRINT 1/0;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case Granting to the sproc is not enough.</p>
<p>I thought I had the perfect solution, the <code>with execute as owner</code></p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE [Reporting].[MyDynamicSproc]
	@ID            int
WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER
AS
....
</code></pre>
<p>This worked. But when a member of <code>ReportingRole</code> tried to execute the sproc, they now received this message:</p>
<pre><code>Problem: Could not obtain information about Windows NT group/user 'MyActiveDirectoryDomain\ASpecificDBAsName', error code 0x534.
</code></pre>
<p>I was surprised to see some random person's name shown as the problem.</p>
<p>I researched and found the owner of the db was 'dbo' and the dbo user was mapped to this NT user account.</p>
<p>Hmmm. What to do?</p>
<p>The main solution people recommended online was to set the owner of the database to 'sa'.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to do this, performed some testing with a different/similar database, which worked fine, when i then tried it on the original database I received:</p>
<pre><code>Msg 15151, Level 16, State 1, Line 74
Cannot find the principal 'sa', because it does not exist or you do not have permission.
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually I looked at the master database, and saw that its owner was also <code>dbo</code> -- but not the same <code>dbo</code> as my specific database. The backing user for that <code>dbo</code> was a <code>SQL_USER</code> called <code>membersa</code></p>
<pre><code>select * from master.sys.database_principals where principal_id = 1
select * from MyDataBase.sys.database_principals where principal_id = 1
</code></pre>
<p>So with great reluctance I ran this:</p>
<pre><code>sp_changedbowner 'membersa'
</code></pre>
<p>...which returned &quot;Commands completed successfully.&quot;</p>
<p>...then re-ran the <code>with EXECUTE AS OWNER</code> on each of the sprocs....</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE [Reporting].[MyDynamicSproc]
	@ID            int
WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER
AS
....
</code></pre>
<p>And now found that members of the reporting role were able to run the sprocs:</p>
<pre><code>-- As member of ReportingRole
exec [Reporting].[MyDynamicSproc] @ID = 1
-- ....succeeds (even though it uses dynamic sql that does things the reporting user can't normally do)
</code></pre>
<p>FIN.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-solution">Alternative Solution</h2>
<p>Another solution which I did not try, but which made sense was from here <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22803561/49">Give permissions to a stored procedure, answer by 'dean' (user 3464852)</a>:</p>
<p>Create a 'limited' user, with an expiry in the distant future (long after your contract runs out, or shortly before) and make them a member of the 'db_owner' role. Have them create a certificate and sign the target sproc.</p>
<pre><code>create certificate cert_raiser
	encryption by password = 'pGFD4bb925DGvbd2439587y'
	with subject = 'raiser',
	expiry_date = '01/01/2114';
go

create user cert_user from certificate cert_raiser
go

alter role db_owner add member cert_user
go

add signature to [Reporting].[MyDynamicSproc]
   by certificate cert_raiser
	with password = 'pGFD4bb925DGvbd2439587y';
go
</code></pre>
<p>And instead of being a member of 'db_owner' -- that user could have been a member of a mich more restricted, but fit for purpose, permission set.</p>
