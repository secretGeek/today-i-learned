<h1 id="windowed-functions-in-sql-server">Windowed Functions in SQL Server</h1>
<p><strong>Pre-requisite: you are expected to be familiar with SQL, including GROUP BY and Aggregates. There is a CTE.</strong></p>
<h2 id="part-1-over-and-over">Part 1: Over and Over</h2>
<p>We all know that this will fail, and why...</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3
	VehicleCode,
	COUNT(*) as [COUNT]
from Reporting.Vehicles
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error</strong> Column 'Reporting.Vehicles.VehicleCode' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't mix aggregates and non aggregates, unless you use GROUP BY. Or can you!?</p>
<p>Watch what happens when we include an <code>OVER()</code> clause...</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3
       VehicleCode,
       COUNT(*) OVER() as [COUNT]
from Reporting.Vehicles
</code></pre>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>VehicleCode</th>
<th>COUNT</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ABC_VH011</td>

</tbody>

<p>Often the only place we're familiar with <code>OVER()</code> from is with the <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code> function. Honestly, most of us treat <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code> as a little bit of magic text that we copy and paste from stackoverflow each time we want to use it.</p>
<p>Let's follow the same process, but instead of the count function we'll start with a <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code>...</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3
       VehicleCode,
       ROW_NUMBER() as ROW_NUMBER
from Reporting.Vehicles
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error</strong> The function 'ROW_NUMBER' must have an OVER clause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we're told that <code>The function 'ROW_NUMBER' must have an OVER clause.</code></p>
<p>So let's include an OVER clause...</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3
       VehicleCode,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER() as ROW_NUMBER
from Reporting.Vehicles
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error</strong> The function 'ROW_NUMBER' must have an OVER clause with ORDER BY.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we're heckled with &quot;The function 'ROW_NUMBER' must have an OVER clause with ORDER BY&quot; and I don't know they didn't say that in the first place?</p>
<p>(And you noticed that the <code>COUNT</code> function above did not require an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause. That's because ROW_NUMBER and COUNT operate under different rules.)</p>
<p>So we'll add that in...</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3
	   VehicleCode,
	   ROW_NUMBER() OVER(order by VehicleCode) as ROW_NUMBER
from Reporting.Vehicles
</code></pre>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And voila! We have our <code>ROW_NUMBER</code>... but let's learn more about what's happening here.</p>
<p>First we need to see exactly what the rules are.</p>
<p>Can you guess what will happen if we order by <code>DESC</code> ?</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3
	   VehicleCode,
	   ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY VehicleCode desc) as ROW_NUMBER
from Reporting.Vehicles
</code></pre>
<p>Will we now get 3,2,1 ?</p>

<p>No, we still got 1,2,3 -- but the <code>top 3</code> Vehicles we were shown were from the <em>end</em> of the list of Vehicles, in descending order.</p>
<p>This takes a little bit of thinking. Since there's no sort order on the outer query, the ordering created by the rest of the query is apparent. And it shows us a little bit about the way in which the ROW_NUMBER was applied. They started applying from the back of the list, i.e. starting at 1.</p>
<p>What if we order the outer query by VehicleCode ascending... will we <em>now</em> get 3,2,1 ?</p>

<p>Can we put a windowed function into the OVER clause???</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3

	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY

		) as ROW_NUMBER

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error</strong> Windowed functions cannot be used in the context of another windowed function or aggregate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we put a windowed function in a WHERE clause?</p>
<pre><code>Select top 3

	   ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY VehicleCode asc) as ROW_NUMBER
from Reporting.Vehicles
where ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY VehicleCode asc) &gt; 4
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error</strong> Windowed functions can only appear in the SELECT or ORDER BY clauses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this stage we've learnt all the rules.</p>
<p>We can follow this old skating maxim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FIRST: Learn all the rules<br />
NEXT: Break all the rules</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's how we <strong>CAN</strong> put a windowed-function into a WHERE clause...</p>
<pre><code>;with TopVehicles AS
(Select
	  VehicleCode,
	  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY VehicleCode asc) as ROWNUM
from Reporting.Vehicles)
select top 3 * from TopVehicles
where ROWNUM &gt; 4
</code></pre>
<p>We use a Common-Table-Expression (CTE) to get one extra level of indirection... now we can filter by our windowed-function.</p>

<p><strong>In fact this is a handy general technique.</strong></p>
<p>You can also apply a windowed function column to a windowed function, if you <strong>first wrap it in a CTE</strong>.</p>
<p>This technique creates a kind of CTE game of Pass-the-Parcel. You may need to wrap up many levels of CTE to get the result you need.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-other-functions">PART 2: Other Functions</h2>
<p>We've finished exploring <code>COUNT</code> and <code>Row_Number</code> functions for now.</p>
<p>A quick look at other functions.</p>
<p>I said above that &quot;ROW_NUMBER and COUNT operate under different rules&quot; -- that's because they are different types of functions.</p>
<p>Y'see, with <code>over()</code> there are <strong>two types of functions</strong> you can use:</p>
<ol>
<li>ALL of the aggregates (e.g. COUNT, SUM, AVG) which you know from GROUPing</li>
<li>&quot;Ranking functions&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="whats-an-example-of-a-ranking-function">What's an example of a Ranking function?</h3>
<p>An obvious example would be the <code>RANK</code> function itself, which we'll get to in a moment.</p>
<p>But <code>ROW_NUMBER</code> is also a ranking function. It's just a very <em>unfair</em> ranking</p>
<pre><code>Select top 5
	   VehicleCode,
	   ReliabilityFactor,
	   RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ReliabilityFactor desc) as RANK_ReliabilityFactor,
	   ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY ReliabilityFactor desc) as ROW_NUM
from Reporting.Vehicles
where ReliabilityFactor is not null and ReliabilityFactor &lt;= 3.50
</code></pre>

<p>The different ranking functions each use a different 'strategy' for numbering.</p>
<p>In the plain old <code>RANK</code> strategy, if two rows are &quot;tied&quot; then they get the same number. And a subsequent number is skipped.</p>
<p>Rank is like the olympics: two people can share a gold medal, but then no one gets the silver.</p>
<p>A different strategy is <code>DENSE_RANK</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Select top 5
	   VehicleCode,
	   ReliabilityFactor,
	   COUNT(*) over () as [Count],
	   RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ReliabilityFactor desc) as RANK_ReliabilityFactor,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY ReliabilityFactor desc) as DENSE_RANK_ReliabilityFactor,
	   ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY ReliabilityFactor desc) as ROW_NUMBER_ReliabilityFactor
from Reporting.Vehicles
where ReliabilityFactor is not null and ReliabilityFactor &lt;= 3.50
</code></pre>

<p>With dense rank, if two people tie for first they both get a gold medal. And the next person gets a silver.</p>
<p>This way you know every type of number will be handed out, at least once, even though ties are allowed.</p>
<p>So it's more fair than 'row number' but has different numeric properties. So it can be useful depending on <em>how</em> you want to join it to other things.</p>
