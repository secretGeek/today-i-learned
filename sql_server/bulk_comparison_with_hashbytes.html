<h1 id="bulk-comparison-with-hashbytes">Bulk Comparison with Hashbytes</h1>
<p>Imagine we have two tables (or views), <code>TableNew</code> and <code>TableOld</code>, and we want to know if their data is the same or different.</p>
<p>Assume they have the same schema.</p>
<p>Further assume that their primary key is a composite key with two columns, <code>PK1</code> and <code>PK2</code>.</p>
<pre><code>With 
NEWSET as (
SELECT 
	MBT.PK1,
	MBT.PK2,
   hashbytes('MD5',
			   (SELECT MBT.*
				FROM (VALUES(NULL))foo(bar)
				FOR xml auto)) AS [Hash]
FROM TableNew AS MBT)
,OLDSET as (
SELECT 
	MBT.PK1, 
	MBT.PK2,
   hashbytes('MD5',
			   (SELECT MBT.*
				FROM (VALUES(NULL))foo(bar)
				FOR xml auto)) AS [Hash]
FROM TableOld AS MBT)
,Comparison as (
Select
	n.PK1,
	n.PK2,
	Case 
		when o.[Hash] is null then 'Not in old set'
		when o.[Hash] != n.[Hash] then 'Changed'
		else 'Same'
	end as Summary
from NewSet n
left outer join OldSet o on n.PK1 = o.Pk1 and n.PK2 = o.PK2
)
,Comparison2 as (
Select
	o.PK1,
	o.PK2,
	'Not in new set' as Summary
from OldSet o
left outer join NewSet n on n.PK1 = o.Pk1 and n.PK2 = o.PK2
where n.PK1 is null and n.PK2 is null -- i.e. not match
)
Select Summary, Count(*)as [Count] from Comparison group by Summary
UNION
Select Summary, Count(*)as [Count] from Comparison2 group by Summary
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you a summary table that tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>how many are in the old set but not the new (based on primary key) <code>Not in new set</code></li>
<li>how many are in the new set but not the old (based on primary key) <code>Not in old set</code></li>
<li>how many are in both sets but with different details in at least one column <code>Changed</code></li>
<li>how many are in both sets and with identical details in every column <code>Same</code></li>
</ul>
<p>e.g.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Summary</th>
<th>Count</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Changed</td>
<td>607534</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not in new set</td>
<td>56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not in old set</td>
<td>7017</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Same</td>
<td>65449</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The maximum input to <code>hashbytes</code> -- prior to SQL 2016 -- is 8000 bytes.</p>
