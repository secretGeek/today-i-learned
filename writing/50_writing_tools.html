<blockquote>
<ol type="I">
<li>Nuts and Bolts</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Begin sentences with subjects and verbs.
Make meaning early, then let weaker elements branch to the right.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Order words for emphasis.
Place strong words at the beginning and at the end.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Activate your verbs.
Strong verbs create action, save words, and reveal the players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be passive-aggressive.
Use passive verbs to showcase the “victim” of action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watch those adverbs.
Use them to change the meaning of the verb.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take it easy on the -ings.
Prefer the simple present or past.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fear not the long sentence.
Take the reader on a journey of language and meaning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish a pattern, then give it a twist.
Build parallel constructions, but cut across the grain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let punctuation control pace and space.
Learn the rules, but realize you have more options than you think.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cut big, then small.
Prune the big limbs, then shake out the dead leaves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="I" start="2">
<li>Special Effects</li>

</li>
<li><p>Give key words their space.
Do not repeat a distinctive word unless you intend a specific effect.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Play with words, even in serious stories.
Choose words the average writer avoids but the average reader understands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get the name of the dog.
Dig for the concrete and specific, details that appeal to the senses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pay attention to names.
Interesting names attract the writer ï¿½ and the reader.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Seek original images.
Reject clichï¿½s and first-level creativity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Riff on the creative language of others.
Make word lists, free-associate, be surprised by language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set the pace with sentence length.
Vary sentences to influence the reader’s speed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vary the lengths of paragraphs.
Go short or long — or make a “turn”– to match your intent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the number of elements with a purpose in mind.
One, two, three, or four: Each sends a secret message to the reader.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when to back off and when to show off.
When the topic is most serious, understate; when least serious, exaggerate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Climb up and down the ladder of abstraction.
Learn when to show, when to tell, and when to do both.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tune your voice.
Read drafts aloud.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Learn the difference between reports and stories.
Use one to render information, the other to render experience.</p>
</li>

Dialogue advances narrative; quotes delay it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reveal traits of character.
Show characteristics through scenes, details, and dialogue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Put odd and interesting things next to each other.
Help the reader learn from contrast.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foreshadow dramatic events or powerful conclusions.
Plant important clues early.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To generate suspense, use internal cliffhangers.
To propel readers, make them wait.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Build your work around a key question.

</li>
<li><p>Place gold coins along the path.
Reward the reader with high points, especially in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat, repeat, repeat.
Purposeful repetition links the parts.</p>
</li>

Turn your notebook into a “camera.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report and write for scenes.
Then align them in a meaningful sequence.</p>
</li>

Use subtle symbols, not crashing cymbals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write toward an ending.
Help readers close the circle of meaning.</p>
</li>
