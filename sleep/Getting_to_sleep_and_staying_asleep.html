<p>Before seeking medical help for &quot;insomnia&quot;, take care of the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce caffeine intake. Definitely no caffeine after 3pm</li>
<li>Reduce alcohol intake.</li>
<li>Remove screen technology from the bedroom. Use software that reduces blue light after dark.</li>
<li>Reduce bedroom temperature (ideal: 17 degrees C.) May require lighter nightwear and bedding.</li>
<li>Establish regular bedtime, even on weekends.</li>
<li>Go to bed only when sleepy</li>
<li>Avoid early/mid-evening naps (e.g. falling asleep on couch while watching TV)</li>
<li>Never lie in bed awake for a significant time period</li>
<li>Remove visible clock faces from bedroom (can create clock-watching anxiety)</li>
<li>Finish workouts at least 2 to 3 hours before sleep. (Exercise generally will improve sleep. Good sleep will powerfully improve exercise)</li>
</ol>
<p>Learn to mentally decelerate before bed to reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts at night. For this, the treatment method is &quot;CBTi&quot;, i.e. &quot;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia&quot;.</p>
<p>If having difficulty sleeping at night, avoid daytime napping. (But if sleeping well, a daytime nap is a great benefit)</p>
<p>(Avoid sleeping pills. But please don't change medication suddenly. And don't change medication based on something you read at <code>secretgeek.net</code> â€” seek medical help first! But equally, if your doctor is twirling an Ambien pen while she talks <em>please</em> switch doctors.)</p>
