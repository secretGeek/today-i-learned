<h2 id="appendix-twelve-tips-for-healthy-sleep">Appendix: Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep</h2>
<p>For me, this was the book I got the most out of in 2018.</p>
<h2 id="criticisms-of-why-we-sleep">Criticisms of &quot;Why We Sleep&quot;</h2>
<p>There was a rather hard-hitting criticism of the book, by Alexey Guzey:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">Matthew Walker's &quot;Why We Sleep&quot; Is Riddled with Scientific and Factual Errors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>...and a later response to criticisms from Dr Walker here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sleepdiplomat.wordpress.com/2019/12/19/why-we-sleep-responses-to-questions-from-readers/">Why We Sleep: Responses to questions from readers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I don't think those initial criticisms do nearly as much as Alexey thinks they do to destroy the entire validity of the work. They're more like editor's notes, fixing a bug here and there. I'll continue to take the work of a professional sleep researcher over an amateur like Alexey who writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been experimenting with sleep for the last month and I converged on a formula of sleeping 4-5 hours per night and then doing as many 20-30 minute naps as I need during the day (1-2 usually).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope to write the synthesis of everything I know about healthy and efficient sleep habits in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be looking forward to <em>that.</em></p>
<p>It is important to know that &quot;Why We Sleep&quot; is not a guide to helping you get better sleep. It gives you so much information about sleep that it can create or exacerbate anxiety, particularly for people who already have sleep-related problems. This is a major issue and thankfully Dr Walker will be putting a note to that effect on the next edition.</p>
