<h1 id="sleep-terminology">Sleep Terminology</h1>
<p>Regarding the title <a href="Getting_to_sleep_and_staying_asleep.html">Getting to Sleep and Staying Asleep</a> article, there's some related terminology I want to record while I recall it.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting to sleep&quot; is referred to as &quot;sleep onset.&quot; If you have trouble getting to sleep, a specialist would say you have &quot;delayed sleep onset.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Staying asleep&quot; is referred to as &quot;maintaining sleep.&quot; If you wake up and can't get back to sleep you have trouble with &quot;sleep maintenance.&quot;</p>
