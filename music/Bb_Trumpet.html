<h1 id="b-flat-trumpets">B-flat Trumpets</h1>
<p>My wife and first born both play trumpet, and it turns out this is a B-flat (Bb) instrument.</p>
<p>I'm not classically trained (or trained at all) so when I learnt what this means I was a bit shocked, though eventually I started to understand and I went from saying: &quot;Well that's just ridiculous!&quot; to &quot;Well that's very clever.&quot;</p>
<p>There are many different sizes of trumpet, and they all use the same fingering to achieve the &quot;same&quot; notes. That's the fiction that they take part in anyway.</p>
<p>Take two very similarly sized trumpets -- a Bb and a slightly smaller C trumpet. The same combinations of fingering are referred to as the same note. But they are in fact pitch-shifted away from each other. The Bb trumpet with the same fingering will (pretty much) produce a tone that is two semitones lower than a C trumpet. They both refer to the note as &quot;G&quot; (for example), even though it is two semitones higher on the littler C trumpet.</p>
<p>So how does such a crazy notion work in the real world, in orchestras, for example? The horn blower will be handed sheet music that is transposed into a different key! So when they think it's time to play a C, and the pianist hits a Bb chord, it will all sound in tune, and no one will be any the wiser (so long as they only look at their own music!).</p>
<p>And what about in smaller, less organised musical groups? It's no surprise to learn that musicians such as trumpeters get very good at transposing on the fly!</p>
<p>Anyway â€” the lesson for me is that whatever note (or key) my Bb-Trumpet playing family <em>say</em> they are playing... I just play a note that is two semitones lower (on my 'concert pitch' guitar) and we should be OK.</p>
