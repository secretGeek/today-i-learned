<p>I found this video interesting....</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlITtBMC8lc">&quot;The Only 4 TYPES Of Bass Lines You'll Ever Need To Create&quot;</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Type 1 monorhythmic chord followers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One consistent rhythm through out (1/4 note or 8th note) follows the chords, just plays the root.</li>
<li>Good for &quot;driving&quot; the band.</li>
<li>Can be done in a &quot;bouncy&quot; way too.</li>
<li>Can be hypnotic for lower energy songs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type 2 - drum rhythm chord followers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rhythm follows the drums (particularly the bass) ... the notes chosen still follow the root of the chords.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type 3 - mimic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Synchronise with the lead instrument - e.g. play the same riff as the guitar or same riff as piano
works for reinforcing and filling out a killer riff, giving a fatter sound.</li>
<li>Works best when there <em>is</em> a killer riff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type 4 - bass solo</strong></p>
<p>Bass does its own thing. Think flea, les claypool. Bass players whos work stands apart from the rest of the song.</p>
