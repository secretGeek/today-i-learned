<h1 id="what-is-up-with-the-7th-chord">What is up with the 7th Chord?</h1>
<p><code>7th</code> chords are very common in blues.</p>
<p><code>A7</code>, <code>D7</code> and <code>E7</code> chords for example, are the staple diet of a blues rhythm guitarist. So much so that if they say &quot;A&quot; they probably mean &quot;A7&quot;. Jazz musicians do this too.</p>
<p>In practice when building one of these chords on guitar, e.g. <code>A7</code>, we replace the 8th note, the <code>A</code>, with a G... which is a <em>flattened</em> 7 in A major. So that's just another hint that musical theory was written by drunks.</p>
<p>(The 8th note, the A, still &quot;belongs&quot; in the chord, but we sacrifice it, omit it, because we need to use that string to play the G. Only have so many fingers on your hands, you know.)</p>
<p>So I looked up &quot;how to build a 7th chord&quot;</p>
<p>And found this short instructional video....</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9SolFRzPyc">Piano Quickie 6: 7th Chords Explained</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So the chord with the flattened 7th is a &quot;dominant&quot; 7th (not a &quot;Major 7&quot;, which would've had the non-flattened 7th). So &quot;A7&quot; (pronounced &quot;A&quot; by some blues rhythm guitarists) is <code>A dom 7</code>. It's also known as a &quot;Major Minor 7th chord&quot; which is perfectly <a href="../concepts/coik.html">COIK</a>.</p>
<p>...then he goes through the <strong>8</strong> different kinds of <code>7th chord</code>....</p>
<ul>
<li>Major 7th: <code>1,3,5,7</code></li>
<li>Dominant 7th (Major Minor 7): <code>1,3,5,b7</code> (This one is kind of a big deal!)</li>
<li>Minor 7th: <code>1, b3, 5, b7</code></li>
<li>Diminished 7th: <code>1, b3, b5, bb7</code></li>
<li>Half-Diminished 7th: <code>1, b3, b5, b7</code></li>
<li>Augmented 7th:  <code>1, 3, #5, b7</code></li>
<li>Augmented-Major 7th: <code>1, 3, #5, 7</code></li>
<li>Minor-Major 7th: <code>1, b3, 5, 7</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Not that you're going to use all of those. At least not in one song. At least not on your first day. (Welcome to <code>7th Club</code>).</p>
<p>Any chord may also have a &quot;sus&quot; variation, what this means (e.g. sus2 or sus4)...</p>
<ul>
<li>Sus2 means &quot;omit the 3rd and play the 2nd instead&quot;</li>
<li>Sus4 means &quot;omit the 3rd and play the 4th instead&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>And all of that was interesting to me -- but here's what I really want to say about 7th chords.</p>
<p>In a lead sheet it may have the chords listed, and they often write in a kind of shorthand.</p>
<p>If it says &quot;Aâ€”&quot; (A followed by a significant dash) then it means &quot;A minor&quot;. If it says &quot;A&quot; it may mean A7. That's what gets me.</p>
<p>And then there's the voicings, i.e. which particular arrangement of keys are used to create that chord. For an A7, here is what my jazz fiend buddy says:</p>
<p>Jazz fiend: For an A [meaning A7] you can leave out the 5th, that's implied anyway</p>
<p>Me: Oh so we leave out... in this case, the E? Because that's contained in the overtones of the root note, the A, right?</p>
<p>Jazz fiend: Yeh, and add the 7th</p>
<p>Me: The G? Okay so we've got an A and a G, what else?</p>
<p>Jazz fiend: Well, now leave out the A, because that's implied anyway.</p>
<p>Me: leave out the A? In an A?</p>
<p>Jazz fiend: yeh. Strip it back.</p>
<p>Me: It's just... it's just a G? Is that even a chord?</p>
<p>Jazz fiend: sure it is. Depends what you hear.</p>
<p>Me: Uhhh, okay.</p>
<p>Jazz fiend: and maybe add this:</p>
<p>(he adds in a C, two octaves up)</p>
<p>Me: so (thinking) that's a... minor... a minor 3rd note?</p>
<p>Fiend: Or this</p>
<p>(he drops the note by half a semi tone)</p>
<p>Me: that's... that's just wrong?</p>
<p>Fiend: yeh it's a better chord. Okay. Maybe leave out the G.</p>
<p>Me: (silence)</p>
<p>I have not spoken since.</p>
