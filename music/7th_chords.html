<h1 id="what-is-up-with-the-7th-chord">What is up with the 7th Chord?</h1>
<p>7th chords are very common in blues.</p>
<p>A7, D7 and E7 chords for example, are the staple diet of a blues rhythm guitarist. So much so that if they say &quot;A&quot; they probably mean &quot;A7&quot;. Jazz musicians do this too.</p>
<p>In practice when building one of these chords on guitar, e.g. A7, we replace the 8th note, the A, with a G... which is a <em>flattened</em> 7 in A major. So that's just another hint that musical theory was written by drunks.</p>
<p>(The 8th note, the A, still &quot;belongs&quot; in the chord, but we sacrifice it, omit it, because we need to use that string to play the G.)</p>
<p>So I looked up &quot;how to build a 7th chord&quot;</p>
<p>And found this short instructional video....</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9SolFRzPyc">Piano Quickie 6: 7th Chords Explained</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So the chord with the flattened 7th is a &quot;dominant&quot; 7th (not a &quot;Major 7&quot;, which would've had the non-flattened 7th). So &quot;A7&quot; (pronounced &quot;A&quot; by some blues rhythm guitarists) is A dom 7. It's also known as a &quot;Major Minor 7th chord&quot; which is perfectly COIK.</p>
<p>...then he goes through the 8 different kinds of 7th chord....</p>
<ul>
<li>Major 7th: 1,3,5,7</li>
<li>Dominant 7th (Major Minor 7): 1,3,5,b7</li>
<li>Minor 7th: 1, b3, 5, b7</li>
<li>Diminished 7th: 1, b3, b5, bb7</li>
<li>Half-Diminished 7th: 1, b3, b5, b7</li>
<li>Augmented 7th:  1, 3, #5, b7</li>
<li>Augmented-Major 7th: 1, 3, #5, 7</li>
<li>Minor-Major 7th: 1, b3, 5, 7</li>
</ul>
<p>Any chord may also have a &quot;sus&quot; variation, what this means (e.g. sus2 or sus4)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sus2 means &quot;omit the 3rd and play the 2nd instead&quot;</li>
<li>Sus4 means &quot;omit the 3rd and play the 4th instead&quot;</li>
</ul>
