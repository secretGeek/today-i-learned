<h1 id="select-single-pixel">Select single pixel</h1>
<p>To select a single pixel (if it's the same color as the pixels around it) zoom right in and use the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p>Or if it's a different color to the pixels around it, use the Magic Wand.</p>
<p>By why do you want to select it?</p>
<p>To delete it? You can make it dissappear by drawing over it with a transparent color. Same result, right? To do this,  choose a color with Alpha of 0 and then using the pencil tool to draw on top of it -- but here's the trick: change the 'overwrite' setting from &quot;Normal blending&quot; to &quot;Overwrite&quot;.</p>
